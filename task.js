//Basic JavaScript.


//7. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

//8. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;


//9. Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
var catName = "Oliver";
var catSound = "Meow!";

let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";

//10. Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword

var fCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
var fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(fCC, fact); // Change this line

const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line

//11. Add Two Numbers with JavaScript

const sum = 10 + 10;

//12. Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

const difference = 45 - 33;

//13. Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
 const product = 8 * 10;

 //14. Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
 const quotient = 66 / 33;

 //15. Increment a Number with JavaScript
 let myVar = 87;
// Only change code below this line
myVar++;

//16. Decrement a Number with JavaScript
let myDecrement = 11;
// Only change code below this line
myDecrement--;

//17. Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
const ourDecimal = 5.7;
// Only change code below this line
const myDecimal = 9.8;

//18. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
const products = 2.0 * 2.5;

//19. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
const quotients = 4.4 / 2.0; // Change this line

//20. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
const remainder = 11 % 3; //remainder gets the value 2
